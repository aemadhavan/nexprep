                  "answer": "License types assigned to users and groups",
                  "explanation": "Different license tiers (E3, E5, Business Standard, etc.) unlock different Microsoft 365 features including Copilot capabilities. Users must be assigned appropriate licenses to access specific features."

                  "answer": "Yes, licenses can be assigned to security groups, and members automatically inherit those licenses",
                  "explanation": "Microsoft 365 supports group-based licensing where you assign licenses to Azure AD security groups. When users are added to the group, they automatically receive the assigned licenses."

                  "answer": "A dedicated instance of Microsoft 365 services that represents an organization",
                  "explanation": "A tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD and Microsoft 365 services. It's created when you sign up for Microsoft 365 and serves as the boundary for your organization's data and configuration."

                  "answer": "Cloud-only identities, synchronized identities, and federated identities",
                  "explanation": "Cloud-only: exist only in Entra ID. Synchronized: synced from on-premises AD to cloud. Federated: authentication happens in on-premises systems but users can access cloud resources."
